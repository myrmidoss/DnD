Creation Guidelines
===================

# NPC Creation #

You can roll dice with the handy character tick and quirk generator. For
important NPCs, however, they need to have a bit more depth. Once you have a
general idea of who you want them to be, and what role they'll have in the
story (perhaps even less than this), you can look at the Myers-Briggs Type
Indicator, to identify what they're like, and how they make their decisions.
This should be the first thing on their character profile, and I should know
what that means for them. It's not perfect, but it should provide some
inspiration to define their character by.

Also, remember: sometimes the most memorable characters are the ones that break
molds. Someone who seems to be both a strong extrovert and a huge introvert
would be a memorable character. And sometimes, character development changes
someone's stance on one of these characteristics, and that's okay.

## Favorite World ##

These characteristics define the character's favorite world to live in--within,
or without. Introversion, or Extraversion.

## Structure ##

What are the behaviors others tend to see? A structured and decided lifesyle or
a more flexible and adaptable one? Everyone extraverts some of the time: this

adapting_ to the world, instead of organizing it.
*   Seen as staying _open to new experiences and information_.

# Puzzle Creation #

1.  Don't be afraid to steal Puzzles
2.  Be very afraid to improvise Puzzles

Basically, this advice comes down to the principle that a puzzle should either
be easily solvable, or non-blocking. Puzzles that are established and proven to
work are a good way to start, but this doesn't have to be the case. The only
problem is that you should _NEVER_ run a puzzle that you haven't prepared for
thoroughly.

Always make sure that there are not only a lot of different solutions
available, but that there are a lot of different solutions available _to the
party_. If they can't successfully use those solutions, then it's not really a
solution.

Some examples of other general solutions are as follows:

*   Breaking the contraption
*   Talking your way out of it if the puzzle guardian is conscious
*   Asking for help from a knowledgeable NPC
*   Using a spell (animate dead, hand of fate, truth field...) to learn the
answer.
*   Using dungeoneering or any other applicable skill to get a hint
*   Using history to try to remember puzzles like these (hints)
