Creation Guidelines
===================

# Character Creation #

You can roll dice with the handy character tick and quirk generator. For
important NPCs, however, they need to have a bit more depth. Once you have a
general idea of who you want them to be, and what role they'll have in the
story (perhaps even less than this), you can look at the Meyers-Briggs Type
Indicator, to identify what they're like, and how they make their decisions.
This should be the first thing on their character profile, and I should know
what that means for them.
