## Intro ##

This should be a short adventure tracking a group of Native Americans across
the continent as they undergo a spiritual quest to save their dying world.
Ideally it can be finished in two sessions. This will require some careful
planning and consideration, and plenty of sacrifices will have to be made in
order to keep it within this time limit. We'll be using the Everway RP system,
so it will be a learning experience in multiple regards. I won't shy to
incorporate other RP elements as well, however. The story will be loosely based
on the progression in Heart of Darkness, borrowing elements from that story to
convey a slow, brooding feeling.

Given that characters will be made at play time, I will have to brainstorm the
possiblities of my pre-rendered story. Namely, this will involve how each
threat, each puzzle, each interaction within the game may represent one of many
different flaws, virtues and fates. Perhaps the fortune deck should be drawn
from for inspiration.

## Lore ##

Perhaps I should read some short exerpts on NA culture before proceeding. In
any case, I want to call this land "Native America". I think that's funny, and
suiting. I can only guess that this will be rife with inaccuracies and that we
will embrace them wholeheartedly as fact in this realm.

My initial ideas are these: the people of their world are nomadic. They roam
the plains, hold no place as their permanent home, and revel in the freedom
that this lifestyle provides. They are a very spiritual people, clinging to
tribes of those who worship similarly. Overall, however, the people of this
land believe in the legend of the Phoenix.

### Legend of the Phoenix ###

The legend of the phoenix can be a short one: this world is tied to the life of
a phoenix. This phoenix lives free, and there are many who claim to have seen
it, or been blessed by its presence in passing. Although the tribes worship
different gods, they all worship the phoenix, the one who sustains nature. This
is achieved when the phoenix molts, and sheds the impurities of the world, only
to be born again in a nest of ashes. She represents the cycle of life, and the
natural way: motherhood, and the cleansing properties of death. Whenever the
world becomes too corrupt, or bogged-down, the phoenix molts, shedding away
evil, and revitalizing the natural world. It is considered virtuous to mirror
the phoenix in life, refusing to waste in any way, shape or form. Nature
deserves the respect and reverence of those who life off of it.

### Other Inspiration ###

This will serve as notes from the native storytelling stuff I listen to.

* Sickness comes from the spirit moving from a person's center into different
parts of the body. Witch doctors/medicine men find this and treat it.
* There is a being that can change shapes, and his purpose is to make life
better for man.
* Thank you from my heart. Thank all of you from my heart.
* Guy rubs his hands together in a lake, turns his dead skin pellets into
salmon, and turns those salmon into a people.
* Some inanimate objects are spiritual. The canoes, for instance, had hearts
carved onto them, to represent that they were still alive. They were alive as
trees, and are still alive as the canoe.
* They name places by the appearance, or the thing it produces.
* Timber wolves travel in pairs. Transformed into a people. (Dude that means
maybe the lonesome people were hyenas or something lonesome.)
* Polygamy for people in power?
* Two little girls captured by ??? while picking berries away from their
village. The elders clarified "do not stray from the path. Go straight home. Do
not stop. Go straight home." So the little girls went until they saw a meadow,
so inviting, that they slept in it. People realized they weren't there, brought
torches and looked, but found nothing. Went back in the morning, saw two small
paths in the grass of the meadow. All the grass was pointing in one direction,
so they knew the girls had not come back, and they knew it was (Cotocqueal?)
because he liked kidnapping bitches. He lived in the sky, a home in the stars.
Make a ladder of the biggest trees they could find, hemlock trees, to build a
ladder to the stars. They carved them into arrows, and then carved a huge cedar
tree into a bow, and they looked for his home. The slug had the sharpest eyes,
and saw the home of the dude, and the hawk got jealous since he thought he had
the sharpest eyes, so he plucked the slug's eyes out. They needed to string the
bow, so a whale says he's the biggest and strongest, fails to string it, a huge
bear is like "I'm stronger blah blah", and then a robin says "I can do it, let
me try!", and everybody laughs at him. The Elk says he's the strongest and
fails. Then everybody's like "YEAH OKAY SURE YOU LITTLE BITCH" and he ended up
doing it. They shot the arrows into the ends of one another and created a
ladder from that dude's home. SO who's gonna ascend the ladder? The eagle led a
party up the ladder. At the top, they got super fuckin cold near the heavenly
body. So a dude is like let's find shit to burn so we can make a fire to get
warm. So they did, but then they had no way to start the fire. They saw a
column of white smoke from chotocqueal's home and decided to get a hot coal.
Chocococo the robin decided he'd go get it, and they're like fuckin whatever.
He could hear him snoring so he went inside but he never came back. So they
decide to send someone else because he probably got eaten. The beaver then says
"fuck this I can swim in cold water, I got this," so when he gets to the home,
he hears two snores. Tidococo stayed next to the fire so long that his breast
turned red. Woke him up, gathered some coals on the beaver's tail, and held it
above water as they went back. His tail had become burnt. The thing is
totocqueal. The scapefish flew out of the water, hit the dude's door (they
decided to go over), but when totocqueal went to see, he couldn't see anything
because the fish can disquise himself, and is flat. He went back to sleep, but
he had to piss first, so he pissed on the fish. So he starts snoring again, and
everybody goes to look for the little girls real stealthy. Found two little
girls, bound and gagged, and they told them to be quiet and book it. So the
blindish slug is slow and looking around, realizes everybody is leaving, and
runs to the door, knocking over firewood. Totocqueal wakes up and is like "FUCK
THAT" and chases after them. They all get to the ladder, but soon totocqueal
gets on the ladder and is so fucking humongous that he breaks it and all the
creatures on the ladder turned into heavenly bodies, floating around forever.
But since he was so big and heavy he fell all the way to earth, and landed in a
swamp, and made a huge indentation in the soft ground. Got up, the indentation
formed a lake. He made the earth his new homeland, found a new totocqueal and
mated and left children all over the place. Animals freak out around him and
his kin. It's sasquatch. He can mimic any noise, and is very stealthy. Any time
you hear a strange noise in the woods, it could very well be sasquatch. This
isn't a bad story to tell while they're looking up at the stars.

### Plot Hook ###

The world is dying. Sick birds fall from the sky, plagued with crusty, black
sores. The valley of warmth, a common crossing for the tribes of the great
plains, is lost to irritable, sickly bison. The tribes are unable to roam, and
are forced into stagnation--a fate that will ultimately bring death. The land
that they currently populate cannot sustain their tribes for much longer.
Concerned for the fate of the world, the leaders of these tribes have elected
members to seek the reason that the Phoenix can no longer cleanse the world.

Not everyone from the tribes can go, however. Firstly, the group should be
small, to ensure the utmost mobility and chance of success. Secondly, some
members needed to stay with their respective tribes. The witch doctors, for
example, are staying to heal and protect the weak. Thirdly, many tribesmen are
sick, and plenty have already seen the cold grip of death. This unlikely group
of adventurers is the only chance the great plans has.

Due to their spiritual nature, and the mystery surroundig the phoenix, the
tribes are unsure as to how to even approach this problem. There is one lead,
however. It is said that the Phoenix flies with the sun, and where the sun sets
onto the earth into the phoenix's nest of ash. This is where the elders believe
our heroes might find the answers they seek. With the corruption of the world
has come something equally as unsettling: the sun has stopped moving across the
sky. It still sets, but it rises and sets in the same place. Thus, our heroes
have only to walk towards the sky-fire to seek the answers.

It is unknown what lies beyond the horizon, as the tribes have never had reason
to continue in that direction, but our heroes are soon to find out. (fun fact,
it sets in the south, and they'll encounter mayan tribes).

### Native America ###

The cards of Native America are The Soldier, The Griffin (reversed) and The
Phoenix (no shit!). The Soldier represents duty, specifically the duty these
people have to their beliefs and gods. This duty is the reason they joined
together, the same reason that you heroes have been selected to undertake this
task. The Griffin (reversed) implies cowardice, however. It represents that,
though the people of this realm have an obligation to do *something*, they dare
not sacrifice _themselves_ for the task. Instead, their cowardice drives them
to force others to go. This cowardice is the very reason that no-one has
ventured to the phoenix's nest. They fear the truth of the world, of their
gods. They fear changing their way of life. In a strange way, their cowardice
forced them into their strength, gave them the sense of duty they now wield.

The fate of this realm is The Phoenix. It will either be of rebirth or
destruction. Who knows? One must venture to the great fire of the sky to learn.
Will the adventurers start a rebirth of the land, casting away the shackles of
the old rule, or will it end this realm forever?

So, what is the.... 

## Story ##

### Overview ###

From Pacific NW to Plateau to Great Basin to Southwest. The land gets more
arid, less hospitable. The heroes travel south into the Aztecan and Mayan
civilizations. The story culminates in the depths of the city of Chichen Itza
(maybe?), at the foot of a ziggurat. If they do any investigation on the way,
they'll hear plenty about Pacal and his triumph over the night. Perhaps Pacal
believes he is the Phoenix.

I think a fair solution would be if the Phoenix was always dead. Flayed atop an
altar, not given the chance to burn. Traded for his wife's life with the gods,
they have given her a new form, inside this terrifying woman (pronounced
cheekbones, sunken eyes, but very beautiful). He was so afraid of living
without her that he destroyed the world just to "bring her back".

Okay, so what happens after you discover the phoenix is dead and confront
Pacal? You're still pressed with the task of saving the world? Or are you. Will
you succumb to the world's destruction, or will you help it in a rebirth? I
think, at the very least, there should be a plot device--the phoenix's flames
are spreading, the plagued are turning, etc etc, basically some disaster
sourcing in Chichen Itza that prompts the heroes to fucking book it.

Honestly I'm not sure. And I might just have to improvize. I'll let the players
decide how to approach the world. How and if to save it.

### Intro -- Pacific NW ###

This is primarily brainstorming, but we'll see.

The story begins with our heroes being ushered to an open council, firelit
under a star-filled sky. The flames crackle across the faces of the three
village elders, seated upon three distinctly decorated seats, carved from wood.
The heroes approach, are greeted, and then debriefed, in character. They will
be allowed one last night amongst their people, but when day breaks, they must
leave for the nest. Each hero understands what is being asked of them, and is
at the very least willing to go.

Have some interesting characters in town. I'll have to come up with a list of
Everway names for improvization. Let them do whatever, and at some point call
time. The camps settle down for the night, there is nothing to do but sleep.
The sky is clear tonight, and the stars flicker to show you just how dark the
sky behind it really is. For a brief moment before going to bed, each of you
looks up beyond the stars and gets a feeling of what's to come (either use
their fates or draw cards, keeping the results in mind).

### Plateau ###

You set out to the south with travel Teepees, and smoked meats. I think smoking
meats is one of the only safe ways to keep it nowadays. The way is littered
with mountain goats, treacherous passes, and, lush crumbling peaks. Snow. That
kind of shit. There should probably be a bridge passageway. Following
flagstones placed by tribesmembers to get out of the mountains. Then some kind
of puzzle to get through that reveals the gateway through the peaks. You can
see across the landscape, and it paints a good picture of the journey to come.
The trail leads down across a flat scape, into beautiful red and brown carved
valleys and canyons. Soon, the canyons become barren, and the landscape
harsher--deadly. As the deathscape curves around the horizon, the blazing sun
sits, fat and low to the earth, deep red.

I think during the mountainous part, there should be some kind of crypt to pass
through. Dungeon-esque.

### The Great Basin ###

You encounter animals like Elk and shit for food, along a trail that snakes
through the land--not made by men. I think the best thing to happen on the
basin is--because of the flatness--for something to be imminent and obvious.
It will give you a hint of other tribes, too afraid to venture south to help.
They stand their distance from you and give you very apprehensive and hostile
looks. It'll be a very non-interactive experience, unless the party is very
insistent, in which case they can absolutely make friends. I'll try to give the
general impression that the tirbes want nothing to do with you.

You pass great mesas and see a glow atop one of them. A shimmering of green,
blue and white. Flashes of yellow. Investigate at your own peril. Climbing the
mesa alone will be a great endeavor (see an entrance a good way up, climb up to
it somehow, helping the others, get to the entrance, snake through winding and
labyrinthian corridors, finally arrive at the top), but will be rewarded by a
terrifying spirit dance scene. Insane huge masks and dust flying everywhere,
the dancers completely ignore you. You see that in the middle, there are three
old women, dancing as lively as teenagers, around the fire. They will be seers,
and are casting shapes from the flame. You're welcome to ask them for advice,
prompting a view from the spirit deck. Then, I think it would be interesting if
they could charm themselves to look young again, sirening you in with their
disguise of youth. I'll decide of any consequences of fucking them based on the
fates etc.

### The Southwest ###

As you delve deeper into the heart of Native America, the lands get nearly
inhospitable. The plants are almost as vicious as the animals, and they sting,
scratch and bite with no fear or remorse. As the sun gets closer, the shadows
get darker and more intense. The sun is red, and casts a wavering heat over the
landscape. It isn't bright, but is blinding nonetheless.

It is here that you encounter a wild, talking coyote. Perhaps it is the heat of
the desert that is making you hear it speak, the wavering lines of the sun
tricking you to think its mouth is contouring to speech. The coyote will try to
trick or whatever you depending on some kind of fortune. Perhaps it won't be a
cotoye, but an owl that speaks of what happens during the night. Some spooky
event you'll now have the jump on.

This part of the adventure will be marked by a lack of food and water, and,
while they're trying to get deeper into the desert, they will need to spend
time and energy finding enough to sustain their journey, which will be the main
conflict of interest.

### The Aztecan Cities ###

There will be a short encounter with a river, crossing it, etc, perhaps helping
someone across--improvise depending on their flaws and fates. Then, in the
distance, they will see something none of them had ever imagined. A sprawling
empire; stone and mud buildings; shimmering gold statues; a vast complex of
life. The city is red with the color of the sun, and black tendrils of shadow
extend from its base towards the heroes. Within this city, they'll learn that
it's Aztecan, and that they're currently between rulers. There should be
encounters with general city problems--pickpockets, run-ins with the guards,
general outsider mischief, etc. As you continue through these empires, you'll
discover that the red of the sun is making color differentiation very
difficult. As you progress, even your allies begin to look different shades of
pure red.

If you want to buy or trade or whatever for food, there should be
opportunities. For instance, you can work for food, you can barter for goods,
etc. I think the general currencies should be different, but you can make it
work, since people tend to value shiny things equally (gems, etc. there should
be opportunities to pick some up earlier in the adventure). As in the Everway
guide, people tend to value gems, gold and other shiny and beautiful things
pretty equally. Other valuables, however, will vary.

It is also at this point that you will learn of Pacal, the Mayan ruler who, as
everyone believes, has captured the sun. Rumors are abound on this topic, and
you can't be sure what's fact and what's exaggeration, if any of it even is
true. Feel free to interject random specific features that people talk about.

### The Mayan Cities ###

The first cities are actually fairly hospitable, for what they are. Still, you
can't help but feel like outcasts in this strange land. Few speak your language
and even fewer sympathize with your people. If you tell them your reason for
coming, they will react with hostility, as you are trying to steal what they
have taken. They do not know, however, anything about the phoenix. This should
be a pretty long stage on the journey, filled with dark quests, and doing some
really fucked up stuff just so you can make it through this world. For instance
someone will steal something integral from you, and you'll have to go get it
back and do some awful shit at the same time. Perhaps your only options to
catch up with the thief are to do evil, to let children get trampled underfoot,
to let a stabbing victim bleed out, etc, etc. Think of plenty of possibilities
like this.

There should also be plenty of people to meet and interact with. Namely, I
think it would be interesting to see the bride of Pacal. Everyone knows, but
nobody says, and they all kind of fear her in a way. She is a woman to be
feared, by looks alone. Perhaps an interesting encounter involving her. And it
would be good if there were some encounters about places to sleep, and making
sure they're secure (or if you don't, dealing with the consequences). I also
want to see how people deal with the newfound corruption in this city. How the
good are fearful, and some even turn bad out of fear. They have poor priorities
in duty, and end up choosing the wrong people to be dutiful to.

The Red City, Chichen Itza. As you approach, you watch the red and black walls,
stacked and engraved with skulls, pass. When you enter, the fear and hate is
real. The denizens of the city give you dark, pissed off looks, and don't
really talk to you. You wade through streets thick with hate. The sun is
massive and the whole landscape is just a monochrome of red. As you approach
the temple, you finally see Pacal, the man who conquered the sun. He stands
still, his headdress casting a tall shadow over you. Soon, however, you
discover that he is weak--he coughs blood, only distinguishable due to its
opacity compared to spit. His eyes are bagged and his features are gaunt. Pacal
explains that he has heard word of your party, and has looked forward to this
moment. It is at this time that you can tell--Pacal is one of your tribesmen,
the only one who dared venture down and explore. Once he was adventurous and
selfless, but the freedom corrupted him and made him fearful. He was the one
who left you the flagstones and other markings that indicated where to go. This
would be a beautiful thing to thread in through the rest of the story.

Pacal explains himself to a small degree, and if the party threatens anything,
he says that he knows he fucked up, but he needs to show them something. He
will show them the phoenix. I think the general jist of it should be that Pacal
left your tribe because the leaders forbid it. He is the manifestation of this
country's lack of duty, and how it turns to cowardice. He disobeyed, and left
alone. He was assumed to be dead by your tribes, but that is obviously not true
(as you had discovered while traveling). He was rebellious and stupid, and left
just because he could. And it was exciting and great, but it led him here and
to all of this. When the world told his wife she would not live forever, Pacal
rebelled once more. He disobeyed the world, and instead of letting it take
everything from him, he took something from it: the phoenix. However, there is
a problem. Pacal killed the Phoenix. The world will never be the same. Will
this end in its destruction, or its rebirth? Only fortune will decide, although
it will have a lot to do with how the players have acted previously in the story.

Queue some reason for the players to gtfo. Perhaps they have finished their
purpose: they understand why it's happening, and that's what was asked of them.
Perhaps there is some natural disaster threadning the city. In any case, the
heroes flee the city, and must deal with the looming threat of the world along
the way. I'm not sure exactly how this will happen, but I'll leave it up to the
players. I should definitely have SOMETHING planned out, though, as a backup.
