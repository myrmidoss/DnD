The Pacific NW

## Starting the Adventure ##

Read the players the Legend of the Phoenix and the Plot Hook. Provide a general
background of the place, and the peoples that their characters come from.
They'll be allowed to improvize to some degree, but within limits.

Then, have them make their characters. Walk them through the process of
choosing vision cards, virtues faults and fates, and each of the stages, namely
the questions stage, for exploring who their characters are. They might be
allowed minimal powers (keep in mind, this is the universe the native americans
believed they lived in. Foresight is possible. Turning into animals is
possible...), but magic should be restrained to some degree. I think it fits
the flavor well enough to have powers, anyhow.

Basically, I think the order should go:

1.  Choose vision cards
2.  Choose virtues, faults and fates
3.  Questions phase
4.  Distribute elemental points
5.  Anything else I forgot

## True Introduction ##

The heroes are ushered under the night sky into an open council, firelit. The
fire pit is not quite bright enough to drown out the great expanse of stars
above them. Seated before this fire, under these stars, are the three village
elders of the Greater Northern Pact. The tall chairs they sit upon, as well as
the wooden stage, was built by the Land Fish tribe in preparation for this
gathering, and the dust and wood shavings still pile on the ground near the
feet. Each chair has markings specific to their tribe, but they somehow
maintain a similar aesthetic.

> "We presume you all know why you are here," the left chief orates across the
night. (You do).

This chief is short and fat, belonging to the tribe labeled Snakes of the Short
Grass. They are allowed to respond.

> "The Natural Order has need of great heroes like you."

The right chief is smiling, calmly, and giving everybody good vibes in general.
He is of the Land Fish tribe.

> "--But not without proving your worth first!" the middle chief snaps.

The middle chief is on the highest chair. He is thin and tall, and has
something of a gaunt face. He is an old, craggy man- much older than the
other elders, but maintains a life in his bones that few can comprehend. His
tribe is the Breeze Wolf.

> "We won't just send anyone out to determine the fate of the world," elder
Breeze Wolf barked. "We don't want OR need another Running Water."

The heroes recall Running Water. Most knew him a bit in their youth, as he was
a prominent feature at these meetings, a promising young man, a potential
addition to the council, until he refused to heed their warnings. Running Water
left his tribe in pursuit of exploration to the south, somewhere the tribe
simply did not go. Running Water took it as a limitation, that the tribe was
holding him back, and threw away his life to explore to the south. Seers had
queried into his fate, and determined that Running Water's presence no longer
remained in this world. Ever since, his tale had been used as an example for
foolish rebellion.

It is at this point that the heroes should be asked to prove themselves
somehow. Perhaps there are others up for the challenge, in competition with the
heroes. This would be best used as an opportunity to introduce the players to
the different aspects of resolving actions: Karma, Drama and Fortune. I think
each challenge should explore a different aspect of the world, and they will
have to explore the benefits and challenges of each. There will be some kind of
physical challenge, some kind of endurance challenge, a mental challenge, and a
spiritual one. This will be for the elemental ability scores, and producing a
familiarity with them.

Once their fates have been decided, and even the suspicious middle elder is
satisfied, they will be told that they will be allowed the night to tell any
loved ones and get anything out of the way, for tomorrow, they venture out at
dawn.

## Mingling ##

They'll probably hang out with each other at this point (it would be easiest on
me if we just assumied they did all of the shit they wanted to do on their own
on their own and left it at that).

Interesting people in town:

* Bear: he's a big, huggable doofus. Super into friendship and all that shit
(m)
* Grey Grass: an elder who hangs out with the scoundrels, and is not allowed on
the council (m)
* Whispers at Night: the town seer (f)
* Dr. Space Man: the witch doctor. This is pross too silly (m)
* Pine Wind: the lead spiritual dancer (f)
* Come up with that shit. Get a list.

## Dreams ##

At some point, call time, and have the heroes know that they need to sleep to
be ready for the big day tomorrow. The camps settle down, and there is nothing
to do but sleep.

As they look up to the clear sky, they notice the darkness behind the
stars--how they flicker just to remind you how black the rest of it really
is. For a brief moment before sleep, each of you looks up at the stars, and
recalls the story of how the stars were formed:

I think it should generally be the original story but have it be that the
constellations are stupid shitty little animals and they weren't the strongest
or the best, but they did it because they knew they had to. Because they knew
they should. And because the others were afraid, and used contempt and mockery
to hide that cowardice.

> One day, two young girls were helping the tribe gather berries. They had
eaten plenty, and so their hands and mouths were red and blue with juice. When
the elder saw this, she dismissed the children: "You two have had enough for
today--go home". As the two girls turned to leave, the elder clarified: "...
and don't stray from the path. Go straight home, and make no stops along the
way". The girls agreed, but, surely enough, when they encountered a patch of
soft meadow grass, they opted to take a break and rest on its pillowy shores.
>
> Naturally, when the tribe returned that night, they discovered the girls were
missing. They gathered their torches, and looked and looked, but found nothing,
and so they stopped for the night. The next morning, they found the meadow
where the girls had stopped, and saw the two indentations in the soft grass
where the girls had layed down, as well as two paths trailing off into the
distance. As the grass wasn't broken, but merely pressed down, the tribe knew
that these girls had not returned the way they left, and that it appears they
were dragged away. Following the trails yielded no results, but the tribe did
have one lead: Totocqueal was a beast who lived in the sky with a penchant for
kidnapping little girls.
>
> And so all the animals from the village gathered together to come up with a
way to save the little girls. They knew he lived in the stars, and so they
decided to build a ladder to his home in the stars. They gathered hemlock trees
and carved them to arrows, and a massive, ancient cedar tree, and carved it
into a bow. They needed someone to string the bow, and so all the strongest
animals got in line to string this massive, rigid cedar tree. One after
another, the animals failed, the whale, the bear, the elk... all the while, the
little robin pleaded to try. Eventually they gave up, and when the robin
successfully strung the bow, the strong animals were flustered with
embarassment.
>
> Next, they needed to find Totocqueal's home among all the stars in the sky.
The hawk began looking, as it believed itself to have the sharpest eyes, but
soon the lowly slug on the ground found the starlit home first. In a fit of
jealousy, the hawk tore out the slug's eyes, as it should be the one to have
the sharpest vision.
>
> This process continued until the ladder was built, by shooting each arrow
into the tail of the last, forming a chain of arrows from Totocqueal's home to
the ground. By the time it was done, the only animals not completely
demoralized were the rejects of the animal kingdom. Thus, when deciding who
should go, the strongest and the smartest, and the fastest animals, all spurned
by those just trying to help, claimed that the newly useful animals might as
well be the ones to go. And so a ragtag team ventured up towards the stars: a
robin, a slug, a beaver, a flatfish... the list goes on.
>
> When they arrive at the stars, they see white smoke billowing out of a house
in the distance, and so they heard towards it. As they hear snoring inside,
they know they are free to enter and search for the little girls. Just as they
thought, they found the little girls without much trouble, and begin escorting
them out of the house. Unfortunately, however, not everyone was as timely. The
slug, newly blinded, is feeling around the back of the house, when it realizes
that everyone else is leaving. In a hurry, he bolts towards the door, only to
crash into a pile of firewood in his blindness. The raucous wakes up
Totocqueal, and before he has much time to think, he sees a crew of animals
making off with his captured girls.
>
> Somehow, miraculously, the animals all make it to the bridge before
Totocqueal. However, it is not long before the lumbering beast catches up. He
jumps onto the ladder, and in his massive weight, destroys it on landing. The
ladder splinters into millions of pieces, and the animals are all sent flying
into space, to float there forever. And there you can still see them, floating
there as constellations, reminders of the importance of duty, and the
consequence of cowardice.

Use a draw from the fortune deck to interpret the meaning of the story for the
heroes, and to get a feeling for what's to come.
