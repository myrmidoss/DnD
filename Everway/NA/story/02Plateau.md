The Plateau
===========

## The Set Out from Shell River ##

The heroes set out from their town with rations of travel teepees and smoked
meats. Also allow the players to take two small, specific, reasonable items
with them. But they have to decide within a few minutes, and I get to veto any
vote. And I'll include a general adventuring pack: rope, travel teepees for the
party, canteens, heavy woven coats (with beautiful designs specific to your
tribes, each with their own name), and your weapons (also with their own
names). The characters should describe the weapons in detail, and have a good
idea of what they are. Weapons are very spiritual items in this culture, and
often have hearts engraved onto them to indicate a livelihood. There are also
rations--it's not super relevant, but they'll probably be smoked meats since
most other things are semi-plagued.

The scenery around begins as a drab, clear river near the ocean, but soon comes
to the mountains. A short climb leaves you right where the elders directed:
through this mountain is the fastest way out of here. It would take days to
walk around, and it is safe _enough_ that it's used a few times a year by
the tribe to forage and seek materials. Up here, it's cold, and the wind whips
up a chill. Snow is frequent, despite how warm it can be down in the village.
Mountain goats hop around this area, and so does the occasional snake. There
are plenty of evergreen trees, and crumbling peaks around. There is an
occasional treacherous pass. It's up to them to travel on now.

## The Bridge Crossing ##

As our heroes continue through a mountain, they discover what a certain symbol
meant on their map--a bridge. There should probably be some kind of flaw coming
into play. It should also be noted that the bridge has cracking footboards, and
unwinding rope binding it together. It will take some skill to cross this
bridge with all party members together. And if it doesn't happen, they'll
either have to continue in different directions, or find another way across. I
think this is best improvised--they're just crossing a bridge, there are
plenty of things to pop up.

## The End of the Road ##

As they get further along the path, they encounter varied sickly animals. Foxes
shyly looking away, covering their sores, ashamed of what's happened. It may be
possible to ask them for direction. You're soon coming to the end of the
descriptions the elders gave you, so you'll need direction soon. They knew of a
specific pass you must go through to cross the mountains, and it can be seen
ominously from the bottom, sitting high above everything, a dark cavern to
consume you. This pass, however, is not easy to reach, and the path to it is
particularly unclear. Thus, you'll need assistance if you want to get there
safely and in time for nightfall (climbing this mountain at night is extremely
dangerous).

If you do ask it for directions, it'll have some idea of where the Phoenix
lays, but not in great detail. It'll also take some effort to communicate with
it, and interpret its signs. It is, however, familiar with the surrounding
mountains, and can give you a variety of paths: the shortest, the safest, and
one inbetween. This choice shouldn't matter much, but it'll dictate how the
tarot card affects the journey (takes too long, has to settle in the mountains
when night comes, some kind of night encoutner, or is too dangerous and some
horrible shit happens on the way).

The safest is a slow, spiraling path up the mountain. Following this path, you
risk letting night fall while you're on the mountain--this was expressly warned
against by the elders. The consequence will be interpreted by tarot cards. The
fastest path is a dangerous, crumbling way straight up the peak. This way will
be extremely fast, but risk falling and losing some item dicated by the cards.
Also, you'll sustain some damage from the fall (major/minor wounds). The other
way is a combination of the two paths, the safest of the fast path, and the
fastest of the slow path. It risks getting there late, and it risks some
danger, but not an exorbitant amount of either. The other two are almost
guaranteed to be late, or to hurt.

## The Runed Peak ##

When the heroes arrive to the top of the mountain, they're greated by a
broad-mouthed cave that shelters them from the wind and, miraculously, from the
cold as well. There are beautiful cave paintings made from blood, clays and
powders smeared across the walls, and engravings that seem to glow with warmth.
All patterns trend in towards the back of the cave where a massive circular
door sits, made of solid stone, and engraved with warnings and wards. The door
shows no handle or keyhole, and appears to operate by some kind of shamanry.

The peak is a safe place to rest, and the elders advise that you stay there for
the night, because the door is easier to open in the morning light. You are
unsure as to why, and the elders only provided one real hint to opening the
door (you suspect because they have never opened it themselves). The way to
open it is two-fold. First, solve a simple puzzle/riddle to find out what to
do, second, do the thing.
