The Drier World
===============

You head out into the desert, completely fucked, etc...

Skip to the desert battle.

# Decisive Desert Battle #

Featuring:

- [Randolph](../characters/Randolph.md)
- [Bart](../characters/Bart.md)
- [Vorniclex](../characters/Vorniclex.md)
- [Urabrask](../characters/Urabrask.md)

So you're at this point. You finally reach the camps. Improvise on any crazy
situations involving sneaking up on the camp and whatnot, but assuming they
just walk up, here's the run-down:

## Greetings ##

Randolph greets you with some cronies. He explains that they've all been
exiled, too, and they've formed something of a brotherhood out here in the
wastes. Randolph will pry into any information you give him that hints you
didn't get exiled from the village. Permitting Bart is still with you, he
will eventually spoil things for you, revealing that you're there to get the
dog, and maybe kill him. Randolph really doesn't like the idea of that, so 
he's gonna get real aggressive, and give you an ultimatum: fight him now, or
go back and fight Hank's village.

The heat starts to rise--a sand wurm is coming in fast. Randolph instructs
the archers in the parapet above to dispatch them. You smell the scent of
bread in the air. The camp's bakers are going at it, conveniently praying to
Vorniclex in time for a meal. The sand worm seems hungry until it arrives,
when Urabrask rises out of it, with another request for you. He starts his
request, but stops. He can smell the bread in the air. He knows what it
means.

Vorniclex rises out of the ovens, the scent of bread wafting his billow-y
essence. If the party chose to fight Randolph, this takes place during combat.
Urabrask rises to meet Vorniclex in appropriate (gargantuan) size.

>"Hungry, are you, brother?" he states, cockily. "Of course, I should have
known you'd be back for more bread, given your... condition."
>
>"Fuck you, Vorniclex. I saw what you did to my shrine."
>
>"Oh, were you using that? I just assumed you wouldn't need it anymore, since,
well, a pony isn't very useful when it loses its one trick."
>
>_Urabrask turns longingly at the party_ "You didn't happen to... get those
things I asked for, did you?"

Now things change depending on if you got the Pin and Sieve or not.

## If the Players Did Not Retrieve the Pin and Sieve ##

Urabrask is panicked. The party notices a massive jet of sand coming towards
the camp.

>"I--I can still raise bread! I don't need those toys!"
>
>"You've lost your touch, brother. Face it. You only raise the unbread now.
Your purity has been soiled, and you'll never raise bread again."
>
>"You're wrong!" _Urabrask motions towards the ovens, currently in use. He
makes pained facial expressions as a dough-y clump hovers, slightly, bulbous
shapes pushing out of it, bubbles popping, a face forming on the ball,
contorting, the mouth and eyes stretching, twisting, becoming more and more
wretched, crippled arms grow from it, it contorts and cries and twitches until
it becomes corrupted by something black and green, and it melts to the floor in
a pool of ruined sludge. Urabrask stares at it, dejected._
>
>"As I thought. You're a shadow of who you were. Without your crutches, you
fumble and fall. For all the times you tried to mock my power in life, you failed to
realize that you never had any--it was all in those tools of yours, and without
them you're nothing. Commanding legions of the unbread. What did you expect?
You're the younger brother. Come Urabrask. We don't need to fight--I've enough
talent for the both of us. Serve me, and we can become even more powerful. Bask
in the glory that is Vorinclex, one and true god of bread."
>
>_Urabrask's face is in a slight grimace_ "You know, Vorinclex. You're right. I
should accept it."
>
>"Exactly! Now you're making some sense."

At about this point, you can start to see, through the ethereal fog, Urabrask's
form is becoming more clear, a Minotaur with crisp musculature, horns carved
like wheat, wings of wheat on his back.

>_Urabrask's raises his hands slowly, clutching magical energy._ "I should just
accept it. I won't let you use this against me. I am Urabrask, raiser of the
Unbread." _The sand between the two entrance stones starts rising slowly, more
and more, into a pointed pillar._
>
>"Now, you know that's not what I meant!"
>
>"Oh, I know exactly what you meant, Vorinclex. You meant for me to serve you
and your useless consumption. No. That's not how this day ends."
>
>"I knew you couldn't be reasoned with. The unbread. It's shameful, Urabrask!
What would father say?"
>
>_Urabrask smiles_ "Father. That's someone I haven't thought about in a long
time." _He laughs._ "He gave us everything he had, and then some. He worked his
hands bare to feed us, but you wanted more. You tried to take more than you
needed, tried to trick him into giving it to you, but he saw it coming from
miles away, so you just took it from us, and we shared, because that's what
brothers do. He was perceptive, Vorinclex, he always knew what was going on.
You want to know what father would say?" _The sand pillar solidifies, and then
shatters, revealing a gleaming glass axe, towering above the party_
>
>_Vorniclex stares in shock._ "No... Brother..."
>
>IN GIANT, Urabrask says "He'd say you're dead, Vorniclex." _Urabrask raises
the sword above his head, and crashes it down into his brother, who turns
assorted bread on the ground into a shield, just in time to block, shattering
into cracked bits after sustaining the blow._

They do this for a bit, swinging, blocking, Vorniclex getting more and more
desperate, pleading to ethos. As Vorniclex despairs, his form becomes more
clear, an unshapely Minotaur, with a very evident gut, horns also carved like
wheat. As Urabrask continues to cleave at him, black and red smoke starts
pouring out of his nostrils with every heated exhale, a dark purple glow in his
eyes.

Now you notice Jorimunda very close, riding her gargantuan sand wurm. She tries
to interfere with the battle, and manages to deflect a few blows, but Urabrask
is too focused, and eventually cleaves through her sand wurm, slaying it.
Jorimunda flies to the ground near the party. You all watch as Urabrask deals
the final blow, murdering his brother, consuming his godly powers, the sword
plunging into the sand, forever a monument to this occasion. The Seive tells
the party that they need to get the fuck out of here, and apologizes for being
so curt with the party (assuming they pissed her off to the extent of bailing),
and that she's got some shit to work through. The explains that she wants
everyone out of the desert, and is tired of all the trouble they've caused, but
also explains that if Urabrask is mad now, (he poofs into a cloud of lingering
black smog), she doesn't want to imagine the creatures he'll create. The desert
is about to come even more of a fuckfest than it has been. As you start to take
off, you hear Urabrask screaming that he's been Bread-trayed and that he
fucking hates bread now.

>"How did Urabrask get here? A sand wurm? There! Let's go!"

Everybody needs to get onto it. You ride it a bit into the distance, dodging
leviathans coming out of the ground, until one sends you hurling into a rock,
knocking the party about. A mutant, crazy as shit sandwurm comes up and
antagonizes the party, Jorimunda tries to mind control it, but can't. She turns
to the leviathan and says that the wurm better be gone by the time she gets back.

Since she wants you out of the desert, and wants to try and have peace to
herself (no fucking people getting into shit), she will agree to take you back
to the village, if you insist. She'll see Hank, call him Stonebreath, and he'll
freak out a little. He'll ask you how you know her and if she said anything,
and be relieved if she didn't reveal anything about his past. Then stuff
changes if Randolph is there.

## If The Players Side Against Randolph ##

Bart stays with you, you fight them while Urabrask and Vorniclex are fighting,
getting bits of the dialogue as you continue, until it's almost all over, and
then the big shit happens. You need to find Atomsk before the final shit goes
down and you need to leave, so trigger a series of skill checks and challenges.
They'll probably have to go and fight the beastmaster. Bandits (p 343) and a
Bandit Captain (p 344). You also have an opportunity to convert the dragonborn
who is into Tanyeris. His name is Blagragrar because Balasar stole his name,
and he, sticking to his honor, accepted the consequences of his bet. Apparently
Balasar tricks people into a false sense of security with their bets.

## If The Players Side With Randolph ##

Bart is vehemently opposed, and refuses to let you do this. You can convince
him you don't actually intend to murder the village, but he'll still be pretty
aggressive. After dealing with Bart, it'll seem pretty much done, but as
Urabrask goes nuts, and swings at Vorniclex, his power will go a little out of
control, and the dead will rise from the sand, namely, everyone who's died
(Bart, the wood elves, some of Alex's men, that one buzzard they killed, and a
few squirrels). Then, they'll go fetch Atomsk, wizard loaf. The humans can be
represented by Zombies (p 316), the rest improvise. Most of Randolph's men will
be dead by the time you leave, but he'll pross have the dragonborn. Also there
should be dangers of getting hit by god-shrapnel.

## No Matter What ##

Randolph has a naughty drawing of a hot red head. It's apparently his baby and
he's going to make it back to the greater realm to find her again. You can
steal it from him, or take it from his dead body, etc, but it's less likely the
second way, since you'll be rushed to boogie.

Once they have Atomsk and are on the road, there will be skill checks to stay
on the wurm, and there will be scenarios where Atomsk will be in danger, and
must be protected by any means possible. Jorimunda recognizes Atomsk and any
time he's in danger, she'll basically say "fuck that dog, Eagus loved that
dog". Atomsk hates kids (gnomes), and that means Jacques, so you can't let him
get too close or he'll snarl and try to attack him. Atomsk is considered a
Mastiff for all intents and purposes (p 332), except he smells like bread and
attracts desert animals. It's important to note that the old desert animals
loved bread, but the new ones revile it.

The party will be confronted by a Peryton (p 251) while escaping, and it will
try to eat their sand wurm. Once it's slain, it'll barf up two fire snakes (p
265) and turn to sand.

Also, while stuff is happening, Atomsk will get distracted by a Mimic, which is
disguised as a loaf of bread sitting conveniently in the desert. The party will
die if it tries to fight everything, so they should pick their battles.

## Back To The Vilage ##

Not much here, but the Sandwich should be roaming around freaking people out,
being his eyes and ears.

### Village Attack ###

So Randolph came back with you for some reason (party choice), and the village
is gonna go through some serious shit. Namely, Hank doesn't want anyone to
leave this realm (he can't go back, because of his shame. That's why he likes
it here. He wants a fresh start). He will strongly oppose you if he learns of
your plans to leave.

The sand witch is roaming around, looking for company. She's lonely and is
strangely attracted to Andral. She won't speak, but she'll get as close as she
can to him as possible.

## Everyone Gets Murdered ##

Events end up in such a way that the clans turn on each other, and mostly end
up murdering each other. The party locks Hank, Randolph and Krogg into the
house and light it on fire. They manage to kill everything standing in their
way. The night is ablaze with the fire, burning over Hank's hole in the ground.
It flickers and illuminates the various huts, emphasizing how haphazardly they
were put together, and in turn, how well-planned the holes were placed. As you
look to the desert, you see a shimmer of eyes lining the horizon, bobbing as
they approach. Their black, haggard shapes are revealed as they walk in front
of Randolph's bonfire, backlit. Krogg is going to come out holding Hank's
corpse, and give a speech about how he was a good guy.

>"Hank only want nice place. New start. He invite criminal in with open arms.
He know past, and see through it. You treated ANY better back home?"

Krogg waits for a pause. The party basically can't do anything to convince him
not to kill them, but I'm open to ideas.

>"NO. You sent here same reason Krogg sent here. They not nice. You no better.
Hank made village good. Made Krogg good person. You want see Krogg bad person?
Here."

Krogg tosses Hank's body aside, and dramatically slams his battle axe into the
ground, cleaving a pretty serious hole. He then addresses Taenerys directly.
Prehaps rephrase if it's too silly.

>"You." _Krogg points at Taenerys._ "Krogg illiterate, Krogg no dumb. Fire;
Dragon. Krogg never like dragon. Dragon want village lose Hank? No Hank."
_Krogg gestures at Hank's corpse on the ground._ "No Hank, Krogg no reason be
nice. Krogg no reason counseling. Draaaagon. Dragon have treasure Krogg want
for Krogg pile. KROGG WRING TREASURE FROM DRAGON SCALY VEINS, AND FEED TO
EARTH."

Apparently Krogg is an earthbound Half-Orc, who believe in the oneness of the
earth, the fairness of brutality, and the fact that we must spill our blood
into the earth once again to nurture it, and make it as strong as we once were.
It gives the earth the strength to carry on, and when blood is not spilled, but
squandered in a corpse, it is wasted in the sky, making the winds a bit
harsher, and the world colder. Thus, when he cleaves into Hank, and spreads
some of his blood across his face, he's being somewhat selfish, but basically
saying that Hank is lending him some of his power. This isn't Grummush canon,
but it's something the orcs of this region have adapted over the years.

As the wind begins to whip, the fire from Hank's thatched hole begins blowing
embers across the village, and you notice huts beginning to burn down, and
thatches lighting aflame.

So, solve this as you will. The general idea is that the village is burning,
and you have some shit to deal with. The pissed-off Half-Orc, and the impending
tide of sandwitches, one of which can be dealth with. There is also the
challenge that this village has some nice shit in it, namely in Krogg's hut,
and it would be beneficial to get it.

Note: Krogg has a dancing axe, and Naivara has a cloak of Elvenkind (if she
dies). Krogg uses this axe with the blood of a fallen friend, and it requires
this to attunement. It bears the eye of Grummush. Also, he wears a ring of
protection. If you go into his home, you find weapons, a lot of gems, and that
stupid tiara that lets you use scorching ray.

## The Flight to the Mountains ##

Get the fuck out.
