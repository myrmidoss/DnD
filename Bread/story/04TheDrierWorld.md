The Drier World
===============

You head out into the desert, completely fucked, etc...

Skip to the desert battle.

# Decisive Desert Battle #

Featuring:

- [Randolph](../characters/Randolph.md)
- [Bart](../characters/Bart.md)
- [Vorniclex](../characters/Vorniclex.md)
- [Urabrask](../characters/Urabrask.md)

So you're at this point. You finally reach the camps. Improvise on any crazy
situations involving sneaking up on the camp and whatnot, but assuming they
just walk up, here's the run-down:

## Greetings ##

Randolph greets you with some cronies. He explains that they've all been
exiled, too, and they've formed something of a brotherhood out here in the
wastes. Randolph will pry into any information you give him that hints you
didn't get exiled from the village. Permitting Bart is still with you, he
will eventually spoil things for you, revealing that you're there to get the
dog, and maybe kill him. Randolph really doesn't like the idea of that, so 
he's gonna get real aggressive, and give you an ultimatum: fight him now, or
go back and fight Hank's village.

The heat starts to rise--a sand wurm is coming in fast. Randolph instructs
the archers in the parapet above to dispatch them. You smell the scent of
bread in the air. The camp's bakers are going at it, conveniently praying to
Vorniclex in time for a meal. The sand worm seems hungry until it arrives,
when Urabrask rises out of it, with another request for you. He starts his
request, but stops. He can smell the bread in the air. He knows what it
means.

Vorniclex rises out of the ovens, the scent of bread wafting his billow-y
essence. If the party chose to fight Randolph, this takes place during combat.
Urabrask rises to meet Vorniclex in appropriate (gargantuan) size.

>"Hungry, are you, brother?" he states, cockily. "Of course, I should have
known you'd be back for more bread, given your... condition."
>
>"Fuck you, Vorniclex. I saw what you did to my shrine."
>
>"Oh, were you using that? I just assumed you wouldn't need it anymore, since,
well, a pony isn't very useful when it loses its one trick."
>
>_Urabrask turns longingly at the party_ "You didn't happen to... get those
things I asked for, did you?"

Now things change depending on if you got the Pin and Sieve or not.

## If the Players Did Not Retrieve the Pin and Sieve ##

Urabrask is panicked. The party notices a massive jet of sand coming towards
the camp.

>"I--I can still raise bread! I don't need those toys!"
>
>"You've lost your touch, brother. Face it. You only raise the unbread now.
Your purity has been soiled, and you'll never raise bread again."
>
>"You're wrong!" _Urabrask motions towards the ovens, currently in use. He
makes pained facial expressions as a dough-y clump hovers, slightly, bulbous
shapes pushing out of it, bubbles popping, a face forming on the ball,
contorting, the mouth and eyes stretching, twisting, becoming more and more
wretched, crippled arms grow from it, it contorts and cries and twitches until
it becomes corrupted by something black and green, and it melts to the floor in
a pool of ruined sludge. Urabrask stares at it, dejected._
>
>"As I thought. You're a shadow of who you were. Without your crutches, you
fumble and fall. For all the times you tried to mock my power in life, you failed to
realize that you never had any--it was all in those tools of yours, and without
them you're nothing. Commanding legions of the unbread. What did you expect?
You're the younger brother. Come Urabrask. We don't need to fight--I've enough
talent for the both of us. Serve me, and we can become even more powerful. Bask
in the glory that is Vorinclex, one and true god of bread."
>
>_Urabrask's face is in a slight grimace_ "You know, Vorinclex. You're right. I
should accept it."
>
>"Exactly! Now you're making some sense."

At about this point, you can start to see, through the ethereal fog, Urabrask's
form is becoming more clear, a Minotaur with crisp musculature, horns carved
like wheat, wings of wheat on his back.

>_Urabrask's raises his hands slowly, clutching magical energy._ "I should just
accept it. I won't let you use this against me. I am Urabrask, raiser of the
Unbread." _The sand between the two entrance stones starts rising slowly, more
and more, into a pointed pillar._
>
>"Now, you know that's not what I meant!"
>
>"Oh, I know exactly what you meant, Vorinclex. You meant for me to serve you
and your useless consumption. No. That's not how this day ends."
>
>"I knew you couldn't be reasoned with. The unbread. It's shameful, Urabrask!
What would father say?"
>
>_Urabrask smiles_ "Father. That's someone I haven't thought about in a long
time." _He laughs._ "He gave us everything he had, and then some. He worked his
hands bare to feed us, but you wanted more. You tried to take more than you
needed, tried to trick him into giving it to you, but he saw it coming from
miles away, so you just took it from us, and we shared, because that's what
brothers do. He was perceptive, Vorinclex, he always knew what was going on.
You want to know what father would say?" _The sand pillar solidifies, and then
shatters, revealing a gleaming glass axe, towering above the party_
>
>_Vorniclex stares in shock._ "No... Brother..."
>
>IN GIANT, Urabrask says "He'd say you're dead, Vorniclex." _Urabrask raises
the sword above his head, and crashes it down into his brother, who turns
assorted bread on the ground into a shield, just in time to block, shattering
into cracked bits after sustaining the blow._

They do this for a bit, swinging, blocking, Vorniclex getting more and more
desperate, pleading to ethos. As Vorniclex despairs, his form becomes more
clear, an unshapely Minotaur, with a very evident gut, horns also carved like
wheat. As Urabrask continues to cleave at him, black and red smoke starts
pouring out of his nostrils with every heated exhale, a dark purple glow in his
eyes.

Now you notice Jorimunda very close, riding her gargantuan sand wurm. She tries
to interfere with the battle, and manages to deflect a few blows, but Urabrask
is too focused, and eventually cleaves through her sand wurm, slaying it.
Jorimunda flies to the ground near the party. You all watch as Urabrask deals
the final blow, murdering his brother, consuming his godly powers, the sword
plunging into the sand, forever a monument to this occasion. The Seive tells
the party that they need to get the fuck out of here, and apologizes for being
so curt with the party (assuming they pissed her off to the extent of bailing),
and that she's got some shit to work through. The explains that she wants
everyone out of the desert, and is tired of all the trouble they've caused, but
also explains that if Urabrask is mad now, (he poofs into a cloud of lingering
black smog), she doesn't want to imagine the creatures he'll create. The desert
is about to come even more of a fuckfest than it has been. As you start to take
off, you hear Urabrask screaming that he's been Bread-trayed and that he
fucking hates bread now.

>"How did Urabrask get here? A sand wurm? There! Let's go!"

Everybody needs to get onto it. You ride it a bit into the distance, dodging
leviathans coming out of the ground, until one sends you hurling into a rock,
knocking the party about. A mutant, crazy as shit sandwurm comes up and
antagonizes the party, Jorimunda tries to mind control it, but can't. She turns
to the leviathan and says that the wurm better be gone by the time she gets back.

Since she wants you out of the desert, and wants to try and have peace to
herself (no fucking people getting into shit), she will agree to take you back
to the village, if you insist. She'll see Hank, call him Stonebreath, and he'll
freak out a little. He'll ask you how you know her and if she said anything,
and be relieved if she didn't reveal anything about his past. Then stuff
changes if Randolph is there.

## If The Players Side Against Randolph ##

Bart stays with you, you fight them while Urabrask and Vorniclex are fighting,
getting bits of the dialogue as you continue, until it's almost all over, and
then the big shit happens. You need to find Atomsk before the final shit goes
down and you need to leave, so trigger a series of skill checks and challenges.
They'll probably have to go and fight the beastmaster. Bandits (p 343) and a
Bandit Captain (p 344). You also have an opportunity to convert the dragonborn
who is into Tanyeris. His name is Blagragrar because Balasar stole his name,
and he, sticking to his honor, accepted the consequences of his bet. Apparently
Balasar tricks people into a false sense of security with their bets.

## If The Players Side With Randolph ##

Bart is vehemently opposed, and refuses to let you do this. You can convince
him you don't actually intend to murder the village, but he'll still be pretty
aggressive. After dealing with Bart, it'll seem pretty much done, but as
Urabrask goes nuts, and swings at Vorniclex, his power will go a little out of
control, and the dead will rise from the sand, namely, everyone who's died
(Bart, the wood elves, some of Alex's men, that one buzzard they killed, and a
few squirrels). Then, they'll go fetch Atomsk, wizard loaf. The humans can be
represented by Zombies (p 316), the rest improvise. Most of Randolph's men will
be dead by the time you leave, but he'll pross have the dragonborn. Also there
should be dangers of getting hit by god-shrapnel.

## No Matter What ##

Randolph has a naughty drawing of a hot red head. It's apparently his baby and
he's going to make it back to the greater realm to find her again. You can
steal it from him, or take it from his dead body, etc, but it's less likely the
second way, since you'll be rushed to boogie.

Once they have Atomsk and are on the road, there will be skill checks to stay
on the wurm, and there will be scenarios where Atomsk will be in danger, and
must be protected by any means possible. Jorimunda recognizes Atomsk and any
time he's in danger, she'll basically say "fuck that dog, Eagus loved that
dog". Atomsk hates kids (gnomes), and that means Jacques, so you can't let him
get too close or he'll snarl and try to attack him. Atomsk is considered a
Mastiff for all intents and purposes (p 332), except he smells like bread and
attracts desert animals. It's important to note that the old desert animals
loved bread, but the new ones revile it.

The party will be confronted by a Peryton (p 251) while escaping, and it will
try to eat their sand wurm. Once it's slain, it'll barf up two fire snakes (p
265) and turn to sand.

Also, while stuff is happening, Atomsk will get distracted by a Mimic, which is
disguised as a loaf of bread sitting conveniently in the desert. The party will
die if it tries to fight everything, so they should pick their battles.

## Back To The Vilage

Not much here, but the Sandwich should be roaming around freaking people out,
being his eyes and ears.
