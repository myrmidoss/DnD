First Exiled Timeline:
---------------------
-Eagus, Jorimunda (witch), Stonebreath, and Anya (druid) arrive.
-They, feeling remorseful after rough bonding, decide to turn a new leaf.
-Eagus eventually sees this as an opp. to test his powers.
  -Convinces Stonebreath to kill Anya (the most useful, who brought squirrels)
  -Says Anya is mutually exclusive to peace & a village
-Murder happens, only the 4 know. The rest are convinced of an accident.
-Immortalize Anya in a statue, town reveres him
-Eagus inspures huge fuckery that causes a horrible chain reaction, wrecking
the village. Jorimunda murders another dude.
-Jorimunda leaves. Eagus leaves.
-Stonebreath changes his name to Hank, fially starting new.
-Hank confides in Randolph, Randolph threatens to spill, Hank manipulates the
town to banish Randolph. Never again has he brought it up. Now that there's an
excuse to kill him, Hank will be free from people who know.

Beforetimes
-----------
Giants - enlightnened, taken down by dinos
Gnomes - Worshipped gods, war, greed and chaos
Minotaur - Became gods kinda.
  When the dino army arrived, Giants fought (died) and the gnomes ran and hid
  forever when enough of them had died to know it was hopeless.
  
"First" Exiles
--------------
Eagus, Jorimunda, Stonebreath, and Anya.
Eagus tricked Hank to kill Anya, and tricked Jorimunda to kill her new love
Hank lied to you. He was the original chief.
  -Regrets killing Anya, as they owe him everything
  -Coked out, flayed an important person in the dwarf society.
These crimes would normally be punishabled by death:
  -The empire was experimenting with new alternatives w/ witch exiling.



So the new party minus Andy can go see The Seive.
Urabrask will make an all-too-convenient appearance on the way (super
conspicuous, like leaning on a wall in the middle of nowhere "oh, no way, what
are you guys doing here?"). He wants you to do something.

He wants you to go get something (secretly, it's something from before he
died). It's where he died, and it's where Jorimunda died (she was trying to
retrieve the same thing). He hints for you to go talk to her, directs you
towards her, and she can tell you where it is. You don't have to do this. But
it's a good idea I guess. No idea what the object is though. Okay. So he wants
you to get his implements because he's tired of raising the unbread. In fact,
he regrets it a bit. His brother makes fun of him for it, and there were grave
consequences for raising the unbread: he's created horrible abominations, and
he's not super happy about it.

Less of a fetch quest. He needs you to do something--the thing he was trying to
do when he died. Maybe it's kind of noble, brings some light to his character,
and why he's a little crazy or erratic. I think Jorimunda should have figured
out the secret/how not to die in there, but she still doesn't want to go back.

How about the labyrinth they used to live in, where they used to make all of
the food? Does he want one of his tools? Vorniclex's bread knife, Urabrask's
Sieve (calls Jorimunda the Sieve in honor of her sacrifice) and rolling pin,
Keranos's millstone. The dinosaurs came and were killing everything: Vorniclex
was killed in his sloth, Urabrask was killed running back for his tools,
and Keranos was killed fighting them. Then they ascended at some point because
the Gnomes revered them so much? He wants it returned to him, and he can't go
get it himself (wards/it's beyond his power/his figure isn't there). They will
give him great power, and he wants them. Anything to fight but a dino? Or no
dino? What if there's an optional quest to use the stuff? To create superbread?

Also you can explore the Gnome old world--like maybe one locked door. The only
things that kept for so long are likely drugs (Primitive Deeg. Duration of 4
hours, makes the user genuinely believe they are an animal of their choice.
They can still talk as normal, but they attempt to act as that animal, and
will assert that they are that animal if questioned. Advantage on handle
animal, disadvantage on charisma/intelligence checks. At the end, they make a
constitution save. On failure, the duration is doubled. The check is made at
the end of each duration, potentially extending the effect to be expotentially
long.)

Other items to find in this place (rewards for puzzles finished) Glasses of the
Lidless (frameless, magic glasses that, when worn, will not allow you to
blink). A ball that, when thrown, bounces after a 10 second delay. Pretty cool
actually. I think they should also see a gnome who disappears and runs back to
the mountains in some path impossible for them to follow. Scrounging around his
old emporium. You can find them in his workshop! Urabrask's. The secret is that
they're all made of bread, so they're technically edible, but they're resistant
to everything normal glasses are. ScROLL of talk to bread. Consider the wand of
wonder as his pin. They probably won't try to use it. Boots of Butter: appear,
at first glance, to be hover boots, but are actually boots that walk on the
floor as if there is a 2-inch thick layer of butter over it: must make a
dexterity save of 13 to not slip and fall while using it--only your feet hover.

I think for magic shit, there should just be some research time associated with
figuring out what it does, or the properties of any item, really.

Flesh out the kid!

OOOHHH MAAAAANNNNN
------------------
What if shit in the real world started going to hell and it showed through the
people who started getting warped through? What could happen? Won't show up
yet, but brainstorm.
These gods could also develop into real gods. Maybe the fixation is only on
bread because that's what they did during life. Once they realize their true
potential, you might have much stronger allies on your hands. Gods worthy of
devotion, or maybe fear. Part of your quest to return to your world will
involve infecting it with these extraplanar troubles.

Updates:
-------
-Pross won't use XP anymore (just to gague diff)

Skip this garbage, go straight to Randolph if they want. If they don't provide
his things, he has nothing to counter Vorniclex with, becomes insanely jealous
and spurned and becomes (relatively) evil. To counter, Vorinclex is a dick, but
of good alignment. Urabrask begins exploring his ability to do things beyond
the realm of bread, and inehrently becomes more powerful. He embraces it and
creates unbread horrors, and wants to destroy all bread. That might be a bit
silly, though. Randolph's people worship Vorniclex when it's convenient (when
they want food), so they'll probably encounter each other and get into a fight.
Urabrask will start destroying shit, and Voniclex will become a little bit
afraid.


Okay so I forgot that shit I wrote on the board. Urabrask is tired of
Vorniclex's shit, he ends up raging, doing something different depending on the
stuff you get for him.

You're just like him
I am no slave to urabrask, incompetent...
